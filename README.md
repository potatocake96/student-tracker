# trackME — contrast (compact) + logo
- Compact controls and toolbar grids → better on mobile.
- Reusable SVG logo appears in header, KPI and as favicon.
- Paste Firebase config into both HTML files; set admin identity in `app.html`.

## Admin identity
```js
const ADMIN_EMAIL = "YOUR_ADMIN_EMAIL@example.com";
const ADMIN_UID   = "PASTE_ADMIN_UID";
```
